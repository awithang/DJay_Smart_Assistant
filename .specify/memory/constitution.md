# EA Helper - Widwa Pa Trade Assistant Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Automation Over Manual Calculation
The system MUST automate all routine, deterministic calculations defined in the "Widwa Pa" technique. This includes Daily Zone offsets (+/- 300, 1000 points from D1 Open) and Position Sizing (Lot calculation based on Risk %). The user should verify, not calculate.

### II. Signal Precision & Verification
Signals generated by the EA MUST strictly adhere to the criteria defined in the reference material (Price Action + Zone + Time). Ambiguous or "close enough" signals should be filtered out to prevent false positives. Accuracy is prioritized over frequency.

### III. Integrated Risk Management
Risk management rules (Risk % per trade, SL distance, RR ratios) are NON-NEGOTIABLE constraints. The system MUST NOT allow trade execution if these parameters are undefined or violate safety limits. Every trade signal implies a specific, calculated risk.

### IV. Visual-First UX
All decision-critical information (Zones, Trends, Signals, Profit/Loss) MUST be visible on the main panel at a glance. The user should not need to open inputs or sub-windows to understand the market state or active risk. The UI design follows the "Dashboard" paradigm.

### V. Simplicity & Robustness
The EA architecture should be lightweight and robust. It MUST handle common trading edge cases (slippage, requotes, connection loss) gracefully without crashing or losing state. Code should be modular to allow easy addition of new signal logic (e.g., adding a new PA pattern).

## Development Guidelines

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: MQL4/MQL5 (implied by EA context, though not explicitly restricted, we adhere to MetaTrader standards).
- **Architecture**: Event-driven (OnTick, OnTimer) with separation of Logic (Signal) and View (Panel).

### Testing Standards
- **Unit Testing**: Signal logic (e.g., "Is this a Hammer?") must be isolated and testable.
- **Visual Testing**: Panel rendering must be verified in the Strategy Tester.

## Governance

### Amendments
Principles can be amended via a Pull Request that updates this Constitution. Changes to principles require a Major version bump (X.0.0).

### Compliance
All new features and code reviews MUST be evaluated against these principles. For example, a feature that adds a manual input for Lot Size without a Risk % check would violate Principle III.
