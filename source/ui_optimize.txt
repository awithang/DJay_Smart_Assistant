Request:

- reduce manual buy and sell button height a bit to equal other buttons to make a bit space because stragety signal section still a bit overlap with Pending alerts button.

- Button and RR toggle options still not smooth like button and options in Auto Strategy section. Please analyse and give me conclusions.


*** Important***
Please remember, you're architect agent please create implement plan only. No coding and all implement have to concentrate on EA performance and all buttons response performance.
